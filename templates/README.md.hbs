# {{projectName}}

A TinyBase app built with {{#if typescript}}TypeScript{{else}}JavaScript{{/if}}
and {{#if react}}React{{else}}Vanilla JS{{/if}}.

## Getting Started

Alongside this file, you will see a directory called `client` (and optionally
one called `server` if you included server code).

To start the web client with Vite, run the following commands:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

PNPM, Yarn, and Bun should also work. Your app will be available at
`http://localhost:5173`, or whichever port Vite specifies in the console.

If you included server code, start the server in a separate terminal, ideally
before starting the client:

```bash
# In a separate terminal
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

After that, start hacking!
